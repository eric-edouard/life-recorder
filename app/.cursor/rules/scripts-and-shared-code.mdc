# Scripts and Shared Code

- The `sync-shared` script in [app/package.json](mdc:app/package.json) copies code from the `../shared` directory into both the app and backend shared folders.
- This ensures that shared logic, types, or utilities are kept in sync between the frontend and backend.
- Use the `watch-shared` script during development to automatically sync changes from the shared directory.
