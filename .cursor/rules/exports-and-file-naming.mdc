# Export and File Naming Conventions

- Each file should have **one named export**, and the export name must match the file name (e.g., `export const MyComponent = ...` in `MyComponent.tsx`).
- This applies to functions, constants, and React components.
- **Exceptions:**
  - Type-only files (e.g., files in [app/src/types](mdc:app/src/types)) and Next/Expo router files (e.g., files in [app/src/app](mdc:app/src/app)) must use a default export.
- Keep files minimal and focused on a single concern.
- Do not add extra functionality or placeholders for future useâ€”implement only what is needed.
